ChessRoyale project. The project was started in the context of a ISEL's class and was continued
after the class ended. Is being used to develop skills learned during the ISEL's Software Engineering graduation.

Plans for the future:
1. Develop both Desktop and Web App. Desktop App developed in Kotlin and Desktop Compose. Web App developed in React and TypeScript.
2. Develop a Server to change the matchmaking system. The actual system doesn't support concurrency very well
3. Add authentication to all component. The authentication will be supported by Firebase Authentication
4. Deploy the server
