Repository that works as a playground to test stuff and do some code

Plans for the future:
1. Develop both Desktop and Web App. Desktop App developed in Kotlin and Desktop Compose. Web App developed in React and TypeScript.
2. Develop a Server to change the matchmaking system. The actual system doesn't support concurrency very well
3. Add authentication to all component. The authentication will be supported by Firebase Authentication
4. Deploy the server
